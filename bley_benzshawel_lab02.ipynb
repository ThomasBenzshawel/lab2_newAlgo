    "### Introduction:\n",
    "The task of checking if a point is located inside a 2D polygon is important in various real-world fields like computer graphics and geographic information systems. However, it is inefficient to do by hand so an algorithm is needed. In this notebook, we will define our algorithm for determining if a point is inside a polygon. Additionally, when implementing these algorithms in real-world applications, it is important to understand how efficient they are on different datasets. To explore the limitations of the algorithm, this notebook explores the run time for each algorithm on different sized polygons. From this we can create a runtime analysis and identify strengths and limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes a detailed breakdown of our algorithm; methods for creating polygons, determining if a point is in a polygon, and benchmarking; and runtime analyses. This notebook explores how the algorithm run time changes as the size of the polygon increases. From these tests, we can deduce if the algorithm is practical with specific datasets. To complete these tasks, the notebook uses the functionality of time, random, and TODO libraries."
